<h1>The Open Wireless Movement</h1>

<p>The Open Wireless Movement is a movement started by the Electronic Frontier
Foundation and various other organizations that have the best interests of
electronic and computer users. The Open Wireless Movement aligns well with the
goals of phone-free people because it allows them to electively choose what
wi-fi connect to and when, rather than requiring them to be connected to a
data plan all the time.</p>

<h1>The Cord-Cutters</h1>

<p>The Cord-Cutters are people who, for reasons of their own, have chosen to eschew
one-to-many media sources when they are outside of the control of the consumer.
Where the Cord-Cutters focus on one-to-many media, the phone-free focus on
retaking control of the one-to-one connections facilitated largely by telephone
technology.</p>
