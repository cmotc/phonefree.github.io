The Cord-Cutters
================

The Cord-Cutters are people who, for reasons of their own, have chosen to eschew
one-to-many media sources when they are outside of the control of the consumer.
Where the Cord-Cutters focus on one-to-many media, the phone-free focus on
retaking control of the one-to-one connections facilitated largely by telephone
technology.
