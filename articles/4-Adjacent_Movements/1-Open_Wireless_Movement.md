The Open Wireless Movement
==========================

The Open Wireless Movement is a movement started by the Electronic Frontier
Foundation and various other organizations that have the best interests of
electronic and computer users. The Open Wireless Movement aligns well with the
goals of phone-free people because it allows them to electively choose what
wi-fi connect to and when, rather than requiring them to be connected to a
data plan all the time.
